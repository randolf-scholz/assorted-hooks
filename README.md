## imported-attributes

This hook checks that if both a module is imported and some class/function from that module, always the directly imported symbol is used.

```python
import collections.abc as abc
from collections.abc import Sequence

def foo(x: Sequence) -> Sequence:
    assert isinstance(x, abc.Sequence)  # <- use Sequence instead of abc.Sequence
    return x
```
